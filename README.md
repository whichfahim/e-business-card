# e-business-card
A simple static digital business card I designed in React. 
To run the project locally, they run 'npm i' before 'ng serve'
Or try running 'npm run-script dev' and copying the localserver address including the socket from the command line.

## Running the app locally
From your command line on Windows, navigate to the root folder, and run the command "npm run dev." Once the localhost server is up, simply copy the url to your browser and voila!
